<h1>Trails Viewer Demo</h1>
<p>A simple implementation of a "trails" viewer, based on an idea taken from <a href="http://softwareas.com/as-we-may-think-url-trails">Michael Mahemoff</a>.</p>
<p>Use the [left] and [right] arrow keys to move between slides, [space] and [backspace] do similar things.</p>
<p>This is very crude and there are a lot of ways it may be improved. Feel free to <a href="http://github.com/psd/trailshow/tree">contribute</a>.</p>
